# TodoList-JS
A simple Todo list app with simple animations, using plain Javascript. 

Features
 - An app that allows you set tasks and add details (example "due date")
 - You can add tasks, set tasks to completed/uncompleted and/or delete tasks
 - You can filter out your tasks to display only completed or uncompleted tasks
 - The app stores your todos on your browser's local storage so that you can always come back to things as you left them.

Future features
 - A welcome page that lets you set your name
 - Details field changed to datepicker/timepicker to set due date to finish tasks
 - Form and Header are made sticky on scroll so scrolling through tasks doesn't move the whole page

 - Tasks will be displayed in task groups on welcome page once you have set your name and added tasks
 - Add cross-browser support 
 - Make styling more mobile-friendly
